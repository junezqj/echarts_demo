The above image is the final effect of this repository. It helps me to help how to use ECharts. And I learned it 
from teacher Pink in Bilibili, who is a humorous and professional teacher. Not that hard, but very useful for people
who don't familiar with ECharts. I firmly believe that you can derive a sense of achievement and programming pleasure 
from this case.
